I've implemented a calculator project with the following features as per specification:

1. Contains addition, subtraction, multiplication, division functions. Additionally, I've added square root, and percentage functions.
2. Created variables and utilised them as indicated in the brief.
3. Created operate function which uses a switch to pick a sub-function.
4. Added clear button as per spec.
5. All buttons are fully implemented.
6. It works!
7. Considered and fixed all of the listed bugs.

Extra credit:

1. Implemented floating point calculations.
